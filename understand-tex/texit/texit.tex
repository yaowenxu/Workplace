\textbf{TeX Live} is the standard distribution of TeX, LaTeX, and related programs produced by TeX user groups worldwide. The distribution runs on the Macintosh, Windows, Linux, and Unix machines, using the same packages and fonts on all these platforms. The binary programs are compiled separately for each platform, but from the same source code. The icon at the top right of our web pages is a link which takes you to the home page of the English language \textbf{TeX Users Group (TUG)}.
